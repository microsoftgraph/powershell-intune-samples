## Use GitHub, Git, and this repository

**Note:** Most of the information in this section can be found in [GitHub Help] articles.  If you're familiar with Git and GitHub, skip to the **Contribute and edit content** section for the specifics of the code/content flow of this repository.

### To set up your fork of the repository

1.	Set up a GitHub account so you can contribute to this project. If you haven't done this, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/join) and do it now.
2.	Install Git on your computer. Follow the steps in the [Setting up Git Tutorial] [Set Up Git].
3.	Create your own fork of this repository. To do this, at the top of the page,  choose the **Fork** button.
4.	Copy your fork to your computer. To do this, open Git Bash. At the command prompt enter:

        git clone https://github.com/<your user name>/<repo name>.git

    Next, create a reference to the root repository by entering these commands:

        cd <repo name>
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/microsoftgraph/<repo name>.git
        git fetch upstream

Congratulations! You've now set up your repository. You won't need to repeat these steps again.

### Contribute and edit content

To make the contribution process as seamless as possible, follow these steps.

#### To contribute and edit content

1. Create a new branch.
2. Add new content or edit existing content.
3. Submit a pull request to the main repository.
4. Delete the branch.

**Important** Limit each branch to a single concept/article to streamline the work flow and reduce the chance of merge conflicts. Content appropriate for a new branch includes:

* A new article.
* Spelling and grammar edits.
* Applying a single formatting change across a large set of articles (for example, applying a new copyright footer).

#### To create a new branch

1.	Open Git Bash.
2.	At the Git Bash command prompt, type `git pull upstream master:<new branch name>`. This creates a new branch locally that is copied from the latest MicrosoftGraph master branch.
3.	At the Git Bash command prompt, type `git push origin <new branch name>`. This alerts GitHub to the new branch. You should now see the new branch in your fork of the repository on GitHub.
4.	At the Git Bash command prompt, type `git checkout <new branch name>` to switch to your new branch.

#### Add new content or edit existing content

You navigate to the repository on your computer by using File Explorer. The repository files are in `C:\Users\<yourusername>\<repo name>`.

To edit files, open them in an editor of your choice and modify them. To create a new file, use the editor of your choice and save the new file in the appropriate location in your local copy of the repository. While working, save your work frequently.

The files in `C:\Users\<yourusername>\<repo name>` are a working copy of the new branch that you created in your local repository. Changing anything in this folder doesn't affect the local repository until you commit a change. To commit a change to the local repository, type the following commands in GitBash:

    git add .
    git commit -v -a -m "<Describe the changes made in this commit>"

The `add` command adds your changes to a staging area in preparation for committing them to the repository. The period after the `add` command specifies that you want to stage all of the files that you added or modified, checking subfolders recursively. (If you don't want to commit all of the changes, you can add specific files. You can also undo a commit. For help, type `git add -help` or `git status`.)

The `commit` command applies the staged changes to the repository. The switch `-m` means you are providing the commit comment in the command line. The -v and -a switches can be omitted. The -v switch is for verbose output from the command, and -a does what you already did with the add command.

You can commit multiple times while you are doing your work, or you can commit once when you're done.

#### Submit a pull request to the main repository

When you're finished with your work and are ready to have it merged into the main repository, follow these steps.

#### To submit a pull request to the main repository

1.	In the Git Bash command prompt, type `git push origin <new branch name>`. In your local repository, `origin` refers to your GitHub repository that you cloned the local repository from. This command pushes the current state of your new branch, including all commits made in the previous steps, to your GitHub fork.
2.	On the GitHub site, navigate in your fork to the new branch.
3.	Choose the **Pull Request** button at the top of the page.
4.	Verify the Base branch is `microsoftgraph/<repo name>@master` and the Head branch is `<your username>/<repo name>@<branch name>`.
5.	Choose the **Update Commit Range** button.
6.	Add a title to your pull request, and describe all the changes you're making.
7.	Submit the pull request.

One of the site administrators will process your pull request. Your pull request will surface on the microsoftgraph/<repo name> site under Issues. When the pull request is accepted, the issue will be resolved.

#### Create a new branch after merge

After a branch is successfully merged (that is, your pull request is accepted), don't continue working in that local branch. This can lead to merge conflicts if you submit another pull request. To do another update, create a new local branch from the successfully merged upstream branch, and then delete your initial local branch.

For example, if your local branch X was successfully merged into the OfficeDev/microsoft-graph-docs master branch and you want to make additional updates to the content that was merged. Create a new local branch, X2, from the OfficeDev/microsoft-graph-docs master branch. To do this, open GitBash and execute the following commands:

    cd microsoft-graph-docs
    git pull upstream master:X2
    git push origin X2

You now have local copies (in a new local branch) of the work that you submitted in branch X. The X2 branch also contains all the work other writers have merged, so if your work depends on others' work (for example, shared images), it is available in the new branch. You can verify that your previous work (and others' work) is in the branch by checking out the new branch...

    git checkout X2

...and verifying the content. (The `checkout` command updates the files in `C:\Users\<yourusername>\microsoft-graph-docs` to the current state of the X2 branch.) Once you check out the new branch, you can make updates to the content and commit them as usual. However, to avoid working in the merged branch (X) by mistake, it's best to delete it (see the following **Delete a branch** section).

#### Delete a branch

Once your changes are successfully merged into the main repository, delete the branch you used because you no longer need it.  Any additional work should be done in a new branch.

#### To delete a branch

1.	In the Git Bash command prompt, type `git checkout master`. This ensures that you aren't in the branch to be deleted (which isn't allowed).
2.	Next, at the command prompt, type `git branch -d <branch name>`. This deletes the branch on your computer only if it has been successfully merged to the upstream repository. (You can override this behavior with the `–D` flag, but first be sure you want to do this.)
3.	Finally, type `git push origin :<branch name>` at the command prompt (a space before the colon and no space after it).  This will delete the branch on your github fork.

Congratulations, you have successfully contributed to the project!
